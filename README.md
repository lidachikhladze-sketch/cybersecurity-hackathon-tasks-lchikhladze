# Cybersecurity Hackathon Tasks – Lida Chikhladze

This repository documents my final assignment for a cybersecurity mentorship program.  
It includes a set of practical challenges in:

- Steganography & Base64 decoding  
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)  
- SQL Injection  
- Network scanning & enumeration  
- Hash cracking methodology  

The goal of this repo is to:

- Demonstrate practical cybersecurity skills  
- Provide reproducible steps (where ethically appropriate)  
- Showcase familiarity with Kali Linux, Nmap, CyberChef, Hashcat, and basic scripting

## Repository Structure  
Each task has its own folder inside `/tasks/`:

- `01-steganography-base64/`
- `02-xss-reflected/`
- `03-sql-injection-lab/`
- `04-network-scanning/`
- `05-hash-cracking/`

Each folder includes a short write-up and any helper scripts used for the challenge.
